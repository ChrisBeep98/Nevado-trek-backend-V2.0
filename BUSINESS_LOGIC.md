# Business Logic - Nevado Trek Backend

## Overview
Complete reservation system for adventure tour management with:
- Bilingual (Spanish/English) support for all customer-facing content
- Anonymous booking system with rate limiting
- Advanced admin panel for complete reservation/event management
- Support for private groups (created by individuals) and public events (joinable by multiple customers)

## Core Business Processes

### 1. Tour Management
- **Tour Creation**: Admin creates tours with bilingual descriptions and pricing tiers
- **Tour Visibility**: `isActive: true/false` for public availability control
- **Tour Structure**: Contains complete information including names, descriptions, pricing, inclusions, FAQs, etc. in both languages

### 2. Event Management
- **Private Events**: Created when individual customer books a new date
- **Public Events**: Previously private events that become joinable by other customers
- **Capacity Management**: Track available slots with `bookedSlots` vs `maxCapacity`

### 3. Booking System
- **Individual Booking**: Customer books a new tour date, creating private event
- **Event Joining**: Customer joins existing public event
- **Reference System**: Unique booking references in format `BK-YYYYMMDD-XXX`
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam (5 min between requests, 3/hour, 5/day per IP)

### 4. Reservation Management
- **Status Tracking**: `pending` → `confirmed` → `paid` → `cancelled` workflow
- **History Logging**: Complete audit trail of all status changes
- **Customer Management**: Full contact information with special notes

### 5. Event Management & Calendar
- **Calendar View**: Admin calendar view with filtering by date range, tour, type, and status
- **Event Types**: Private (individual booking origin) and public (joinable by multiple customers) events
- **Event Statuses**: active, full, completed, cancelled
- **Capacity Management**: Real-time capacity tracking for events
