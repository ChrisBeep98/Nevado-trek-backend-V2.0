5. **Document**: Update API usage documentation
6. **Commit**: Add changes to repository

### Quality Assurance
- All functions must pass ESLint validation
- Rate limiting should be properly implemented
- Error handling with structured responses
- Proper admin authentication where required
- Data validation for all inputs

## Current Development Status

6. **Test the new endpoint thoroughly**

## Resource Allocation
- **Developer**: 1 (primary implementation)
- **Timeline**: Phase 2B: 2-3 weeks
- **Tools**: Firebase CLI, Node.js, Firestore emulator (when available)
- **Dependencies**: Google Cloud account, Firebase project access

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Firestore Limits**: Monitor read/write operations for cost control
- **Race Conditions**: Use transactions for critical operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Balance between spam protection and customer experience

### Business Risks  
- **Admin Security**: Secret key should be moved to Firebase Secrets
- **Capacity Management**: Real-time availability validation
- **Data Consistency**: Proper denormalization strategy

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All 8 current functions operational with 99% uptime
- Rate limiting preventing spam while allowing legitimate customers
- Proper error handling with <5% internal server errors
- Fast response times (<2s for all endpoints)

### Business Metrics
